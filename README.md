## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

You will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) that is resolvable and connectable both from Plone and any end-clients. ONLYOFFICE Document Server must also be able to POST to Plone directly.

You can install free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Docs or scalable Enterprise Edition with pro features.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install Enterprise Edition, follow instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-enterprise-index.aspx).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Installing Plone ONLYOFFICE integration plugin

1. Installation instructions can be found under [Manage add-ons and packages](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/manage-add-ons-packages.html).
2. To activate, go to `Site Setup` -> `Add-ons` and press the `Install` button to enable the plugin.

You can also install the plugin via Docker:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e ADDONS="onlyoffice.plone" plone/plone-backend:6.0 start
```

**Please note:** If you have the previous plugin version installed (earlier plugin versions with the previous name *onlyoffice.connector*), please remove it before installing the new version. 

## Configuring Plone ONLYOFFICE integration plugin

To configure the plugin, go to `Site Setup`. Scroll down to the `Add-ons Configuration` section and press the `ONLYOFFICE Configuration` button.

Starting from version 7.2, JWT is enabled by default and the secret key is generated automatically to restrict the access to ONLYOFFICE Docs and for security reasons and data integrity. 
Specify your own **Secret key** on the Plone configuration page. 
In the ONLYOFFICE Docs [config file](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/signature/), specify the same secret key and enable the validation.

## Developing Plone ONLYOFFICE plugin

Run this command to install the addon from the local repository:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e DEVELOP="/app/src/onlyoffice.plone" -v /path/to/onlyoffice.plone:/app/src/onlyoffice.plone plone/plone-backend:6.0 start
```

For more information, check [Developing packages variable](https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/install/containers/images/backend.html#developing-packages-variable).

## Upgrade Plone ONLYOFFICE integration plugin
1. Update instructions can be found under [Manage add-ons and packages](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/manage-add-ons-packages.html).
2. Navigate to the Add-on screen (add `/prefs_install_products_form` to your site URL) and in the Upgrades list select **onlyoffice.plone** and click *Upgrade onlyoffice.plone*.

## How it works

The ONLYOFFICE integration follows the API documented [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/basic):

* User navigates to a document within Plone and selects the `ONLYOFFICE Edit` action.
* Plone prepares a JSON object for the Document Server with the following properties:
  * **url**: the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server uses to download the document;
  * **callbackUrl**: the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server informs about status of the document editing;
  * **key**: the UUID+Modified Timestamp to instruct ONLYOFFICE Document Server whether to download the document again or not;
  * **title**: the document Title (name).
* Plone constructs a page from a `.pt` template, filling in all of those values so that the client browser can load up the editor.
* The client browser makes a request for the javascript library from ONLYOFFICE Document Server and sends ONLYOFFICE Document Server the docEditor configuration with the above properties.
* Then ONLYOFFICE Document Server downloads the document from Plone and the user begins editing.
* ONLYOFFICE Document Server sends a POST request to the `callback` URL to inform Plone that a user is editing the document.
* When all users and client browsers are done with editing, they close the editing window.
* After 10 seconds of inactivity, ONLYOFFICE Document Server sends a POST to the `callback` URL letting Plone know that the clients have finished editing the document and closed it.
* Plone downloads the new version of the document, replacing the old one.

## ONLYOFFICE Docs editions

ONLYOFFICE offers different versions of its online document editors that can be deployed on your own servers.

* Community Edition (`onlyoffice-documentserver` package)
* Enterprise Edition (`onlyoffice-documentserver-ie` package)
